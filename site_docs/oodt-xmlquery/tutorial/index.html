<h2><a name="Understanding_the_XMLQuery"></a>Understanding the XMLQuery</h2>
      
<p>Apache OODT's <a href="../../profile/">profile servers</a>, <a href="../../product/">product servers</a>, and other
	components all use the same format for a query.  It's
	encapsulated by the class
	<tt>org.apache.oodt.xmlquery.XMLQuery</tt>.  In this tutorial,
	we'll look at this class and see how it represents queries.
	You'll need this knowledge both to make queries to OODT
	servers, as well as to understand queries coming into OODT
	servers.
      </p>
    </div>

    
<div class="section">
<h2><a name="Basic_Query_Concepts"></a>Basic Query Concepts</h2>
      
<p>Capturing various aspects of a query is difficult to do in
	general, and OODT's implementation is not stellar or complete.
	But, it has proved succesful in a variety of applications, so
	let's see what concepts it encapsulates.
      </p>

      
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="XML"></a>XML?</h3>
	
<p>First, forget the fact that the XMLQuery has &quot;XML&quot; in its
	  name.  It doesn't mean you can query only XML resources.
	  It's called XMLQuery probably because the person who came up
	  with it thought XML was pretty cool, or that you can
	  represent an OODT query in XML format.
	</p>

	
<p>While you <i>can</i> represent an XMLQuery in XML, you
	  usually only use the Java representation, that is, you
	  create and manipulate Java objects of the class
	  <tt>org.apache.oodt.xmlquery.XMLQuery</tt>.
	</p>
      </div>

      
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Generic_Queries"></a>Generic Queries</h3>
	
<p>In theory, the XMLQuery can represent <i>any</i> query
	  for information.  It captures generic aspects of a query,
	  such as the domain of the question being posed, the range in
	  which the desired response should be formulated, and
	  constraints on what selects the response.  In XMLQuery
	  parlance, we call these the &quot;from element set&quot; (domain), the
	  &quot;select element set&quot; (range), and the &quot;where element set&quot;
	  (constraints).
	</p>

	
<p>In practice, none of the current OODT implementations use
	  any but the &quot;where element set.&quot;  And indeed, for most
	  problems presented to OODT, that is sufficient.  However,
	  the framework is there to support more aspects of a query,
	  and you're welcome to use them in your own deployments.
	</p>
      </div>

      
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Query_Metadata"></a>Query Metadata</h3>
	
<p>The XMLQuery concept captures metadata about a query as
	  well, such as the title for the query, whether the query
	  itself is secret or classified, how many results to return
	  at most, how to propagate the query through a network, and
	  so forth.  In practice, though, none of these additional
	  attributes are used in current deployments of OODT.
	  Moreover, none of the current OODT components obey such
	  settings such as maximum number of results or propagation
	  types.
	</p>

	
<p>As a result, you should ignore these aspects of the
	  XMLQuery and merely use its default values.  We'll see these
	  shortly.
	</p>
      </div>

      
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="XMLQuery_Structure"></a>XMLQuery Structure</h3>
	
<p>The following diagram shows the XMLQuery and related classes (note the diagram is outdated; &quot;jpl.eda.xmlquery&quot;
	    should read &quot;org.apache.oodt.xmlquery&quot;):</p>

	
<p><img src="../images/xmlquery.png" alt="Class diagram of XMLQuery" /></p>

	
<p>A single <tt>XMLQuery</tt> object has three separate
	  lists of <tt>QueryElement</tt> objects, representing the
	  &quot;from&quot;, &quot;select&quot;, and &quot;where&quot; element sets.  In practice,
	  the &quot;from&quot; and &quot;where&quot; sets are empty, though, as mentioned.
	  There's also a single <tt>QueryHeader</tt> object
	  capturing query metadata.  Within the <tt>XMLQuery</tt>
	  itself is additional query metadata.  Finally, there's
	  exactly one <tt>QueryResult</tt> object which captures
	  the results of the query so far.
	</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    
<div class="section">
<h2><a name="Boolean_Expressions"></a>Boolean Expressions</h2>
      
<p>The XMLQuery class uses lists of <tt>QueryElement</tt>
	objects to represent its &quot;from&quot;, &quot;select&quot;, and &quot;where&quot; element
	sets.  The lists form a postfix boolean stack, with the
	zeroth element of the list being the top of the stack.
	Although you can populate these stacks by manipulating their
	corresponding <tt>java.util.List</tt>s, the XMLQuery class
	provides a boolean expression language that lets you directly
	populate them.
      </p>

      
<p>The XMLQuery class also respects that some queries just
	cannot be formulated as a boolean expression.  In these cases,
	you can pass in a string that the XMLQuery will otherwise
	carry unparsed.  Note that your profile and product servers
	will then have the responsibility of handling that string in
	some appropriate way.
      </p>

      
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Query_Language"></a>Query Language</h3>
	
<p>The query language that XMLQuery uses to generate postfix
	  boolean stacks is a series of infix, not postfix,
	  element-and-value expression linked by boolean operators.
	  Here's an example:
	</p>

	
<div class="source">
<pre>temperature &gt; 36 AND latitude &lt; 45</pre></div>

	
<p>As you can see, these are <i>triples</i> linked in a
	  logical expression.  Each triple has the form
	  (<var>element</var>, <var>relation</var>, <var>literal</var>).
	  For example, the first triple has <var>element</var> =
	  <tt>temperature</tt>, <var>relation</var> = GT
	  (greater-than), and <var>literal</var> = 36.  That triple is
	  linked to the next one with the boolean <tt>AND</tt>
	  operator.
	</p>

	
<p>The full set relation operators include: <tt>=</tt> (EQ),
	  <tt>!=</tt> (NE), <tt>&lt;</tt> (LT),
	  <tt>&lt;=</tt> (LE), <tt>&gt;</tt> (GT),
	  <tt>&gt;=</tt> (GE), <tt>LIKE</tt>, and
	  <tt>NOTLIKE</tt>.  The logical operators include
	  <tt>AND</tt>, <tt>&amp;</tt>, <tt>OR</tt>,
	  <tt>|</tt>, <tt>NOT</tt>, and <tt>!</tt>.  You can
	  use parenthesis to group things too.
	</p>

	
<p>Here are a few more examples:</p>

	
<div class="source">
<pre>specimen = Blood
bac &gt; 0.05 AND priors = 3
surname LIKE 'Simspon%' OR numChildren &lt;= 3 AND RETURN = numEpisodes</pre></div>
      </div>

      
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Expression_Stacks"></a>Expression Stacks</h3>
	
<p>The &quot;where&quot; element set is actually a
	  <tt>java.util.List</tt> of
	  <tt>org.apache.oodt.xmlquery.QueryElement</tt> objects, arranged
	  in a boolean stack with the top of the stack as the zeroth
	  element in the list.  <tt>QueryElement</tt> objects
	  themselves have two attributes, a role and a value.
	</p>

	
<p>The role tells what role the <tt>QueryElement</tt> is
	  playing.  It can be <tt>elemName</tt> for the
	  <var>element</var> part of a triple, <tt>RELOP</tt> for
	  the <var>relation</var> part of a triple, <tt>LITERAL</tt>
	  for the <var>literal</var> part of a triple, or
	  <tt>LOGOP</tt> for a logical operator linking triples
	  together.  The value tells what the element is, what the
	  relational operator is, what literal value is being related,
	  or what the logical operator is.
	</p>

	
<p>The <tt>XMLQuery</tt> parses a query expression and
	  generates a corresponding stack of <tt>QueryElement</tt>s.
	  Let's look at a couple examples.  The expression
	</p>
	
<div class="source">
<pre>latitude &gt; 45</pre></div>
	
<p>generates the &quot;where&quot; stack</p>
	<img src="../images/small-stack.png" alt="Stack of three query elements" />

	
<p>While the expression</p>
	
<div class="source">
<pre>artist = Bach AND NOT album = Poem OR track != Aria</pre></div>
	
<p>generates the &quot;where&quot; stack</p>
	
<p><img src="../images/large-stack.png" alt="Stack of a lot of query elements" /></p>
      </div>

      
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="The_RETURN_Element"></a>The RETURN Element</h3>
	
<p>A special element is reserved by XMLQuery:
	  <tt>RETURN</tt>.  It's used to indicate what to select,
	  and so any value specified with <tt>RETURN</tt> goes
	  into the &quot;select&quot; set, not the &quot;where&quot; set.
	</p>

	
<p>Moreover, the <tt>RETURN</tt> element doesn't pay
	  attention to how it's linked with boolean expressions in the
	  rest of query, or what relational operator is used with the
	  literal value being returned.  For example, that means
	  <i>all</i> of the following expressions would generate
	  <i>identical</i> XMLQueries:
	</p>

	
<div class="source">
<pre>specimen = Blood AND RETURN = volume
specimen = Blood OR RETURN = volume
specimen = Blood AND RETURN != volume
specimen = Blood AND RETURN &lt; volume
specimen = Blood AND RETURN LIKE volume</pre></div>

	
<p>All <tt>QueryElements</tt> from RETURN triples would go
	  into the &quot;select&quot; instead of the &quot;where&quot; set.
	</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    
<div class="section">
<h2><a name="Constructing_a_Query"></a>Constructing a Query</h2>
      
<p>To construct a query, you'll use a Java constructor of the
	following form:
      </p>
      
<div class="source">
<pre>XMLQuery(String keywordQuery, String id, String title,
  String desc, String ddId, String resultModeId, String propType,
  String propLevels, int maxResults, java.util.List mimeAccept,
  boolean parseQuery)</pre></div>

      </table>

      
<p>All of the values above can be set to <tt>null</tt> to
	use a default or non-specific value (except for
	<tt>maxResults</tt> and <tt>parseQuery</tt>, which are
	<tt>int</tt> and <tt>boolean</tt> types and can't be
	assigned <tt>null</tt>).  For most applications, using
	<tt>null</tt> is perfectly acceptable.  Since the OODT
	framework doesn't use <tt>maxResults</tt>, you can use any
	value.  However, specific profile servers' and product
	servers' query handlers may pay attention to value if so
	programmed.
      </p>

      
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Parsed_or_Unparsed_Queries"></a>Parsed or Unparsed Queries</h3>
	
<p>The last parameter, <tt>parseQuery</tt>, tells if you
	  want the <tt>XMLQuery</tt> class to parse your query and
	  generate boolean expression stacks (discussed above) or not.
	  Set to <tt>true</tt>, the class will parse the string as
	  if in the XMLQuery language described above, and will generate
	  the &quot;from&quot;, &quot;select&quot;, and &quot;where&quot; element boolean stacks.  Set
	  it to <tt>false</tt> and the class won't parse the string
	  or generate the stacks.  It will instead store the string for
	  later use by a profile server's or product server's query
	  handler.
	</p>

	
<p>For example, if you pass in the XML query language
	  expression,</p>

	
<div class="source">
<pre>donutsEaten &gt; 5 AND RETURN = episodeNumber</pre></div>

	
<p>then set the <tt>parseQuery</tt>
	  flag to <tt>true</tt>.  As another example, suppose the
	  query expression is
	</p>

	
<div class="source">
<pre>select episodeNumber from episodes where donutsEaten &gt; 5</pre></div>

	
<p>This is an SQL expression, probably targeted to a product
	  server than can handle SQL expressions.  In this case, set
	  <tt>parseQuery</tt> to false.
	</p>

	
<p>The current OODT deployments for the Planetary Data System
	  and the Early Detection Research Network both use
	  <i>parsed</i> queries.
	</p>
      </div>

      
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Acceptable_MIME_Types"></a>Acceptable MIME Types</h3>
	
<p>Internet standards for mail, web, and other applications
	    use <abbr title="Multipurpose Internet Mail      Extensions">MIME</abbr> types (described in <a class="externalLink" href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2046.txt">RFC-2046</a>
	    amongst other documents) to describe the content and media
	    type of data.  So does OODT.  When you construct an
	    <tt>XMLQuery</tt>, you can also pass in a list of MIME
	    types that are acceptable to you for the format of any
	    returned products, much in the same way your web browser
	    tells a web server what media types it can display.
	</p>

	
<p>The list of acceptable MIME types is only used for product
	  queries since products can come in any shape and flavor.
	  Profile queries ignore the list; profiles are always
	  returned as a list of Java
	  <tt>org.apache.oodt.profile.Profile</tt> objects.
	</p>

	
<p>You've probably seen MIME types before, but here are some
	  examples in case you haven't:
	</p>

	
<ul>
	  
<li><tt>text/plain</tt> - a plain old text file</li>
	  
<li><tt>text/html</tt> - a hypertext document</li>
	  
<li><tt>image/jpeg</tt> - a picture in the JPEG/JFIF format</li>
	  
<li><tt>image/gif</tt> - a picture in the GIF format</li>
	  
<li><tt>audio/mpeg</tt> - an audio file, probably in the MP3 format</li>
	  
<li><tt>video/mpeg</tt> - a video file, probably in the MP2 format</li>
	  
<li><tt>application/msword</tt> - a Micro$oft Word document</li>
	  
<li><tt>application/octet-stream</tt> - binary data</li>
	</ul>

	
<p>In the <tt>XMLQuery</tt> constructor, you can pass in a
	  list of MIME types that shows your <i>preference</i> for
	  returned products.  Product servers' query handlers examine
	  the query to see if they can provide a matching product,
	  <i>and</i> they examine the list of MIME types to see if
	  they can provide matching products in the format you desire.
	</p>

	
<p>As an example, suppose you create a MIME type list as follows:</p>

	
<div class="source">
<pre>List acceptableTypes = new ArrayList();
acceptableTypes.add(&quot;image/tiff&quot;);
acceptableTypes.add(&quot;image/png&quot;);
acceptableTypes.add(&quot;image/jpeg&quot;);</pre></div>

	
<p>and you pass <tt>acceptableTypes</tt> as the
	  <tt>mimeAccept</tt> parameter of the
	  <tt>XMLQuery</tt> constructor.  This tells query
	  handlers receiving your query that you'd really prefer a
	  TIFF format image.  However, failing that, you'll accept a
	  PNG format image.  And, as a last resort, a JPEG will do.
	</p>

	
<p>You can also use wildcards in your MIME types.  Suppose we
	did the following:</p>

	
<div class="source">
<pre>List acceptableTypes = new ArrayList();
acceptableTypes.add(&quot;image/tiff&quot;);
acceptableTypes.add(&quot;image/png&quot;);
acceptableTypes.add(&quot;image/*&quot;);</pre></div>

	
<p>Now we tell query handlers in product servers that we
	  really prefer TIFF format images.  If a query handler can't
	  do that, then a PNG format will be OK.  And if a query
	  handler can't do PNG, then <i>any</i> image format will be
	  fine, even loathesome GIF.
	</p>

	
<p>If you pass a <tt>null</tt> or an empty list in the
	  <tt>mimeAccept</tt> parameter, the OODT framework will
	  convert into a single item list: <tt>*/*</tt>, meaning
	  any format is acceptable.

<h2><a name="aRunning_XMLQuery"></a>&quot;Running&quot; XMLQuery</h2>
      
<p>The <tt>XMLQuery</tt> class is also an executable class.
	By running it from the command-line, you can see how it
	generates its XML representation.  It also lets you pass in a
	file containing an XML representation of an XMLQuery and
	parses it for validity.
      </p>

      
<p>Let's try just seeing that XML representation.  (In these
	  examples, we'll be using a Unix <tt>csh</tt> like
	  command environment.  Other shells and non-Unix users will
	  have to adjust.)
      </p>

      
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Collecting_the_Components"></a>Collecting the Components</h3>
	
<p>First up, we'll need two components:</p>

	
<ul>
	  
<li><a href="../../commons/">OODT Common Components</a>.  This
	    is needed by all of OODT software; it contains general
	    utilities for starting servers, parsing XML, logging, and
	    more.
	  </li>
	  
<li><a href="../../xmlquery/">OODT Query Expression</a>.  This
	    contains the <tt>XMLQuery</tt> and related classes.
	  </li>
	</ul>

	
<p>Download the binary distribution of each of these packages
	  and extract their contents.  Then, create a single directory
	  and collect the jar files together in one place.
	</p>

      </div>

      
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Generating_the_Query"></a>Generating the Query</h3>
	
<p>To generate the query, pass the command-line argument
	  <tt>-expr</tt>.  That tells the XMLQuery that the rest
	  of the command line is the query expression.  It will expect
	  it to be in the XMLQuery query language (meaning that it
	  will create an <tt>XMLQuery</tt> object with
	  <tt>parseQuery</tt> set to <tt>true</tt>).
	</p>

	
<p>Here's an example:</p>

	
<div class="source">
<pre>% <b>java -Djava.ext.dirs=. \
  org.apache.oodt.xmlquery.XMLQuery \
  -expr donutsEaten \&gt; 5 AND RETURN = episodeNumber</b>
kwdQueryString: donutsEaten &gt; 5 AND RETURN = episodeNumber
fromElementSet: []
results: org.apache.oodt.xmlquery.QueryResult[list=[]]
whereElementSet:
[org.apache.oodt.xmlquery.QueryElement[role=elemName,value=donutsEaten],
org.apache.oodt.xmlquery.QueryElement[role=LITERAL,value=5],
org.apache.oodt.xmlquery.QueryElement[role=RELOP,value=GT]]
selectElementSet:
[org.apache.oodt.xmlquery.QueryElement[role=elemName,value=episodeNumber]]
======doc string=======
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;query&gt; . . .</pre></div>

	
<p>The program prints out some fields of the XMLQuery such as
	  the &quot;from&quot; element set, the current results (which should
	  always be empty since we haven't passed this query to any
	  product servers), the &quot;where&quot; element set, and the &quot;select&quot;
	  element set.  It then prints out the XML representation.
	</p>

	
<p>If you examine the XML representation closely, you'll see
	  things like the list of acceptable MIME types:
	</p>
	
<div class="source">
<pre>&lt;queryMimeAccept&gt;*/*&lt;/queryMimeAccept&gt;</pre></div>
	
<p>This says that any type is acceptable.  You'll also see the
	passed in query string:</p>
	
<div class="source">
<pre>&lt;queryKWQString&gt;donutsEaten &amp;gt; 5 AND
  RETURN = episodeNumber&lt;/queryKWQString&gt;</pre></div>

	
<p>Regardless of whether you passed <tt>true</tt> or
	  <tt>false</tt> in the <tt>parseQuery</tt> parameter,
	  the <tt>XMLQuery</tt> always saves the original query
	  string.  For unparsed queries, this is how the string is
	  packaged on its way to a product server.  For parsed
	  queries, product servers will use the boolean stacks.
	  (Since this was a parsed query, you'll also see the boolean
	  stacks in XML format if you look closely.  They're there.)
	</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    
<div class="section">
<h2><a name="Getting_Results"></a>Getting Results</h2>
      
<p>Alert readers will have noticed that the results of a query
	have a place in <tt>XMLQuery</tt> objects.  This actually
	applies to product queries only.  After sending an
	<tt>XMLQuery</tt> to a product server, the query object
	comes back adorned with zero or more matching results.  You
	then access the <tt>XMLquery</tt> object methods to
	retrieve those results.
      </p>

      
<p>The following class diagram demonstrates the relationship (again, the diagram is outdated;
          &quot;jpl.eda.xmquery&quot; should read &quot;org.apache.oodt.xmlquery&quot;):</p>

      
<p><img src="../images/results.png" alt="Result class diagram" /></p>

      
<p>As you can see, a single query has a single
	<tt>org.apache.oodt.xmlquery.QueryResult</tt>, which contains a
	<tt>java.util.List</tt> of
	<tt>org.apache.oodt.xmlquery.Result</tt> objects.
	<tt>Result</tt> objects may have zero or more
	<tt>Header</tt>s, and <tt>Result</tt> objects may
	actually be <tt>LargeResult</tt> objects.
      </p>

      
<p>To retrieve the list of <tt>Result</tt> objects, call the
	<tt>XMLQuery</tt>'s <tt>getResults</tt> method, which
	returns the <tt>java.util.List</tt> directly.
      </p>

      
<p>Each result also includes</p>
      
<ul>
	
<li>An identifier.  In the case there's more than one matching
	  results, this identifier (a string) should be unique amongst
	  results.
	</li>
	
<li>A MIME type.  This tells you what format the matching product is in.</li>
	
<li>A profile ID.  This is currently unused.</li>
	
<li>A resource ID.  This is also unused.</li>

	
<li>A validity period.  This is the number of milliseconds for
	  which the product is considered valid.  You can use this
	  information to decide how long to cache the product within
	  your own program before having to retrieve it again.
	</li>

	
<li>A flag indicating whether the product is classified.
	  Classified or secret products shouldn't be cached or should
	  otherwise be handled carefully by your application program.
	</li>
      </ul>

      
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Result_Headers"></a>Result Headers</h3>
	
<p>The headers of a result are optional.  They're used for
	  tabular style results to indicate column headings.  Each
	  <tt>Header</tt> object captures three strings, a name, a
	  data type, and units.
	</p>

	
<p>For example, suppose you retrieved a product that was a
	  table of temperatures at various locations on the Earth.
	  There might be three headers in the headers list:
	</p>

	
<table border="0" class="bodyTable">
	  <thead>
	    
<tr class="a">
	      
<th rowspan="2">List Index</th>
	      
<th colspan="3">Header</th>
	    </tr>
	    
<tr class="b">
	      
<th>Name</th>
	      
<th>Data Type</th>
	      
<th>Units</th>
	    </tr>
	  </thead>
	  <tbody>
	    
<tr class="a">
<td>0</td>
<td>latitude</td>
<td>float</td>
<td>degrees</td></tr>
	    
<tr class="b">
<td>1</td>
<td>longitude</td>
<td>float</td>
<td>degrees</td></tr>
	    
<tr class="a">
<td>2</td>
<td>temperatuer</td>
<td>float</td>
<td>kelvins</td></tr>
	  </tbody>
	</table>

	
<p>Suppose the product you get back as a picture of a tissue
	  specimen.  In this case, there would be <i>no</i> headers.
	</p>
      </div>

      
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Getting_the_Product_Data"></a>Getting the Product Data</h3>
	
<p>To retrieve the actual data comprising your product, call
	  the <tt>Result</tt> object's <tt>getInputStream</tt>
	  method.  This returns a standard
	  <tt>java.io.InputStream</tt> that lets you access the
	  data.  How you interpret that data, though, depends on the
	  MIME type of the product, which you can get by calling the
	  <tt>Result</tt>'s <tt>getMIMEType</tt> method.
	</p>

	
<p>For example, if the MIME type was <tt>text/plain</tt>,
	  then the byte stream would be a sequence of Unicode
	  characters.  If it were <tt>image/jpeg</tt>, then the
	  bytes would be image data in JPEG/JFIF format.

<h2><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>
      
<p>In this tutorial, we learned about the structure of the
	standard query component in OODT, the <tt>XMLQuery</tt>.
	We saw the query language that XMLQuery supports and how it
	generates postfix boolean expression stacks.  You can also
	encode any query expression by using a special constructor
	argument that tells XMLQuery to not parse the query string.
	We also execute the <tt>XMLQuery</tt> class directly.
	Finally, we saw how product data is embedded in the XMLQuery
	and how to deal with such results.
      </p>

      
<p>As a client of the OODT framework, you can now create
	<tt>XMLQuery</tt> objects to query product servers from
	within your Java applications.  As a server in the framework,
	you know how to deal with incoming query objects.
