<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
    
    
<p>The purpose of this guide is to instruct the user in some advanced concepts 
    within the CAS-Metadata project, including the ramifications of metadata
    extraction with regard to repository search, type, checking, etc, and the use 
    of mime-type detection. For basic topics, including the basics of metadata, how 
    to write metadata extractors, and explanations of existing metadata extractors, 
    see our <a href="../user/basic.html">Basic Guide.</a> In the rest of this guide, 
    we will cover the following topics:</p>

<h2><a name="Planning_Metadata_for_Search"></a>Planning Metadata for Search</h2>
    
    
<p>As discussed in the <a href="../user/basic.html">Basic Guide,</a> one of the
    primary uses of metadata is search. When you consider search, remember that
    neither the CAS-Metadata container nor the CAS-Filemgr are cognizant over
    how people will search your data - you are.</p>
    
    
<p>We recommend developing a data dictionary as a &quot;best practice.&quot; The 
    <a class="externalLink" href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=541721">IBM Dictionary of 
    Computing</a> describes a data dictionary as a &quot;centralized repository of 
    information about data such as meaning, relationships to other data, origin, 
    usage, and format.&quot; This is a highly-related concept to ontology.</p>
    
    
<p>The attributes of and relationships between products in your system will
    not only help you to develop appropriate product types but also the metadata
    you will need to extract from products to establish both these attributes and
    relationships.</p> 
    
    
<p>In the next subsections, we will discuss specific aspects of metadata 
    extraction that impact downstream search.</p>
    
    
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Missing_Elements"></a>Missing Elements</h3>
    
    
<p>Because metadata extraction is a separate activity from extraction (as 
    discussed in the <a href="../user/basic.html">Basic Guide</a>), it is possible
    that there is a miss-match between the metadata elements extracted by an 
    extractor and the metadata elements that the CAS-Filemgr associated with 
    a product type. CAS-Filemgr, therefore, only ingests the <i>intersection</i>
    of the metadata extracted from the product and the metadata associated with
    the product in CAS-Filemgr configuration. This means that missing elements
    are possible.</p>
    
    </div>
    
    
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="String-based_Comparison"></a>String-based Comparison</h3>
    
<p>Metadata values are stored as strings in CAS-Metadata. While there are a 
    number of good reasons for this, it is a design point that has a number of 
    important ramifications for search. Specifically, all metadata elements should
    be comparable. Of course strings are comparable, but without some forethought, a
    string-based comparison can act differently than would a type-based comparison.</p>
    
    
<p>This is where standards come into play. For various types, there are standard
    string-based representations that ensure comparisons that behave identically to how
    a type-based comparison would work. There is currently no plan to enforce these 
    standards (and, depending on the particular type, the application domain, etc., 
    there might be multiple competing standards - e.g., TAI vs. UTC formatted Time 
    strings).</p>
    
    
<p>Some example string representation standards by type:</p>
    
    
<p><b>Date-Time</b></p>
    
    
<p>With time, consistency is key. There are multiple formats, such as 
    <a class="externalLink" href="http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/mjd.html">Julian Day Numbers</a>, or UTC. 
    Additionally, there are different time standards such as 
    <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime">UTC</a>, local time, and 
    <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/tai/">TAI</a>. One also needs to be 
    aware of leap second observance and local time conventions such as daylight savings 
    time, depending on representation and standard selection.</p>
    
    
<p>Additionally, it is important to remember that inter-product consistency can be 
    just as important as intra-product consistency because there are many downstream 
    use cases of the search features of CAS-Filemgr and other CAS components that 
    involve cross-product comparisons.</p>
    
    
<p><b>Integers</b></p>
    
    
<p>Integers can be easily represented as comparable strings, but you must remember
    to pad correctly. The string &quot;1&quot; is greater than &quot;01234&quot;, but &quot;0001&quot; is less than 
    &quot;01234.&quot;</p>
    
    
<p>Like Date-Time, appropriate numerical representation is the responsibility
    of the metadata extractor, though we have built some additionally support for 
    representational transformations during the ingest process of the CAS-Filemgr.</p>
        
    
<p>More on Padding..</p>    
        
    
<p><b>Floating Point Numbers</b></p>    
    
    
<p>The most prevalent of Floating point representations is 
    <a class="externalLink" href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4610933">IEEE 754-2008.</a>
    This is a convenient representation because, amongst other reasons, it is the 
    representation that Java uses so if you use Java to develop an extractor, you can 
    use the <tt>floatToIntBits(float value)</tt> method of the <tt>Float</tt> 
    class. Remember that, like Integers, you will need padding.</p>  
    
    
<p><b>Blobs, URLs, and Character Sets</b></p>    
    
    
<p>Remember that text encoding is important. Depending on the catalog extension 
    point used by the CAS-Filemgr, metadata values might not be formatting correctly
    for storage. For example, if a metadata object containing a blob of text is ingested
    into a CAS-Filemgr instance that is configured to run with a DataStore extension 
    backed by an Oracle DBMS, then UTF8 encoding is important.</p>
