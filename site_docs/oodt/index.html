<td>The Apache Software Foundation provides support for the Apache community of open-source software projects.
    The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus based development process, an open and
    pragmatic software license, and a desire to create high quality software that leads the way in its field.

<td><a href="../pcs-input/index.html">Process Control System Input Data Package</a></td>

<tr class="b">
<td><a href="../cas-metadata/index.html">Catalog and Archive Service Generic Multi-valued Metadata Container</a></td>
<td>A Multi-valued, generic Metadata container class. The class uses an internal
	Map of string keys pointing to vectors of strings. The data
	structure looks like the following:

	[std:string key]&#x21d2;std:vector of std:strings

	The multi-valued nature of the class is handled transparently by this Metadata
	container. Since all values are stored internally as string vectors, the difference
	between a scalar value and a non-scalar is handled by determining whether the list of
	values for a particular key is greater than 1.</td></tr>

    manner.  Its centerpiece is a class called XMLQuery that uses
    boolean postfix expressions to capture the domain, range, and
    constraint of a query, regardless of the source of the query (SQL,
    keyword query, etc.).  It can also encapsulate the results of a
    query.  It's used by many other components as the standard way to
    pass a query and its results between servers, clients, nodes, and
    other components.</td></tr>

  they may be queried across and ingested into.</td></tr>

<tr class="a">
<td><a href="../oodt-product/index.html">Product Service</a></td>
<td>The Product Service provides access to data products.  Products can be
        scientific datasets, images, documents, or anything with an electronic
        representation.  The Product Service accepts standard query expressions (see
        the Query Expression component) and returns zero or more matching products.
        In addition, the product service can transform products from proprietary
        formats and into Internet standard formats or run other transformations, all
        without impacting local stores or operations.</td></tr>
<tr class="b">
<td><a href="../oodt-profile/index.html">Profile Service</a></td>
<td>The Profile Service describes and locates resources using metadata
    descriptions.  These descriptions, called profiles, tell of a
    resource's inception, composition, and location using a mix of
    Dublin Core and ISO-11179 metadata as well as URIs for locations.
    The Profile Service catalogs metadata descriptions and provides
    creating, updating, and querying capabilities.</td></tr>
<tr class="a">
<td><a href="../web-grid/index.html">OODT Web Grid</a></td>
<td>The OODT grid services (product and profile services) use CORBA or
    RMI as their underlying network transport.  However, limitations
    of CORBA and RMI make them inappropriate for large-scale
    deployments.  For one, both are procedural mechanisms, providing a
    remote interface that resembles a method call.  This makes
    streaming of data from a service impossible, because there are
    limitations to the sizes of data structures that can be passed
    over a remote method call.  Instead, repeated calls must be made
    to retrieve each block of a product, making transfer speeds
    horribly slow compared to HTTP or FTP.  (Block-based retrieval of
    profiles was never implemented, resulting in out of memory
    conditions for large profile results, which is another problem.)
    Second, both CORBA and RMI rely on a central name registry.  The
    registry makes an object independent of its network location,
    enabling a client to call it by name (looking up its last known
    location in the registry).  However, this requires that server
    objects be able to make outbound network calls to the registry
    (through any outbound firewall), and that the registry accept
    those registrations (through any inbound firewall).  This required
    administrative action at institutions hosting server objects and
    at the institution hosting the registry.  Often, these firewall
    exceptions would change without notice as system adminstrators
    changed at each location (apparently firewall exceptions are
    poorly documented everywhere).  Further, in the two major
    deployments of OODT (PDS and EDRN), server objects have almost
    never moved, nullifying any benefit of the registry.  This
    project, OODT Web Grid Services, avoids the prolems of CORBA and
    RMI by using HTTP as the transport mechanism for products and
    profiles.  Further, it provides a password-protected mechanism to
    add new sets of product and profile query handlers, enabling
    seamless activation of additional capabilities.</td></tr>
<tr class="b">
<td><a href="../oodt-xmlps/index.html">XML-configured, DBMS-based Product and Profile Server</a></td>
<td>An XML-configured DBMS-based Product and Profile meant to easily 
	  sit on top of Web-Grid and other Product and Profile server contexts
	  for rapid deployment and integration.</td></tr>
<tr class="a">
<td><a href="../opendapps/index.html">Apache OODT Configurable OPeNDAP Profile Server</a></td>
<td>A generic, configurable Apache OODT profile server
  implementation that easily connects to OPeNDAP data sources. Connections 
  are configured via an XML configuration file, providing information on how 
  to extract and translate datasets from OPeNDAP and THREDDS into OODT profiles.</td></tr>
