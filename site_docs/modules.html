<tr class="b">
<td><a href="../index.html">OODT Core</a></td>
<td>The Apache Software Foundation provides support for the Apache community of open-source software projects.
    The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus based development process, an open and
    pragmatic software license, and a desire to create high quality software that leads the way in its field.
    We consider ourselves not simply a group of projects sharing a server, but rather a community of developers
    and users.</td></tr>

<tr class="a">
<td><a href="../pcs-input/index.html">Process Control System Input Data Package</a></td>
<td>The Process Control System's data handling package. This package contains data structures
  and readers and writers to write an input file format similar to HDF, as represented in XML.</td></tr>
<tr class="b">
<td><a href="../cas-metadata/index.html">Catalog and Archive Service Generic Multi-valued Metadata Container</a></td>
<td>A Multi-valued, generic Metadata container class. The class uses an internal
	Map of string keys pointing to vectors of strings. The data
	structure looks like the following:

	[std:string key]&#x21d2;std:vector of std:strings

	The multi-valued nature of the class is handled transparently by this Metadata
	container. Since all values are stored internally as string vectors, the difference
	between a scalar value and a non-scalar is handled by determining whether the list of
	values for a particular key is greater than 1.</td></tr>
<tr class="a">
<td><a href="../cas-filemgr/index.html">Catalog and Archive File Management Component</a></td>
<td>The file management component of a Catalog and Archive Service. This component

<td><a href="../cas-workflow/index.html">Catalog and Archive Workflow Management Component</a></td>
<td>The workflow management component of a Catalog and Archive Service. This component
     purposefully separates workflow repositories and workflow engines standard interfaces, and
