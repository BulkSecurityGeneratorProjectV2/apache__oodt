<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
        
<p>
          This is the developer guide for the Apache OODT Catalog and Archive Service (CAS) 
          Push Pull framework, or Push Pull for short. Primarily, this guide 
          will explain the Push Pull architecture and interfaces, including its 
          tailorable extension points. For information on installation, configuration,
          and examples, please see our <a href="../user/basic.html">User Guides.</a>
          
          
<p>The remainder of this guide is separated into the following sections:</p>
      
<ul>
        
<li><a href="#section1">Project Description</a></li>
        
<li><a href="#section2">Architecture</a></li>

<div class="section">
<h2><a name="Project_Description"></a>Project Description</h2>
        
<p>The Push Pull framework is responsible for downloading remote content (pull),
        or accepting the delivery of remote content (push) to a local system staging area 
        for use by the <a href="../../crawler">CAS Crawler Framework</a> to ingest into 
        the <a href="../../filemgr">CAS File Manager</a>. The Push Pull framework is extensible 
        and provides a fully tailorable Java-based API for the acquisition of remote content.</p> 
      </div>
      
      <a name="section2"></a>
      
<div class="section">
<h2><a name="Architecture"></a>Architecture</h2>
      
        
<p>In this section, we will describe the architecture of the Push Pull framework,
        including its constituent components, object model, and key capabilities.</p>
      
        
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Components"></a>Components</h3>
        
        
<p>The major components of the Push Pull Framework are the Daemon Launcher, the Daemon, 
        the Protocol Layer, and the File Retrieval System, to name a few.  The relationship between 
        all of these components are shown in the diagram below:
        </p>
        
        
<p><img src="../images/pp_extension_points.png" alt="Push Pull Framework Architecture" /></p>
        
        
<p>The Push Pull Framework provides a Daemon Launcher, responsible for creating new 
        Daemon instances. Each Daemon has an associated Daemon Configuration, and has the 
        ability to use a File Retrieval Setup extension point. This class is responsible for 
        leveraging both a Protocol and a File Retrieval System to obtain ProtocolFiles, based on 
        a File Restrictions Parser, that yields eventually a VirtualFileStructure (VFS) model. The 
        VFS defines what files to accept and pull down from a remote site.
        </p> 
        
        </div>
        
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Object_Model"></a>Object Model</h3>
        
<p>The critical objects managed by the Push Pull Framework include:</p>
        
        
<ul>
          
<li><b>Protocol</b> - A pluggable means of obtaining content over 
          some file acquisition method, e.g., FTP, SCP, HTTP, etc.</li>
          
          
<li><b>Protocol File</b> - Metadata information about a remote file, 
          including its ProtocolPath.</li>
          
          
<li><b>Protocol Path</b> - A pointer to a remote Product file's (or files') 
          location, which can be used to derive metadata and determine where to place the file
          in the local staging area built by the Push Pull Framework.</li>
          
          
<li><b>Remote Site</b> - Descriptive information about a remote site, including 
          the username/password combination, as well as a origin directory to start interrogating.</li>
        </ul>

        
<p>Each Protocol delivers one or more Protocol Files. Each ProtocoFile is associated with a 
        single RemoteSite, and each ProtocolFile is associated with a single ProtocolPath. These 
        relationships are shown in the below figure.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Key_Capabilities"></a>Key Capabilities</h3>
        
<p>The Push Pull Framework has been designed with a new of key capabilities in mind.
        These capabilities include:</p>
        
        
<p><b>Flexibility</b> - ability to plug in different Metadata Extractors, 
        Data Protocols, Content Types, etc.</p>
        
        
<p><b>Support Push/Pull</b> - Support of both &quot;Push&quot; and &quot;Pull&quot; 
        style data transfers.</p>
        
        
<p><b>Extensibility</b> - ability to add new, previously undiscovered Data Protocols, 
        and &quot;plug&quot; them into the framework.</p>
        
        
<p><b>Java-based</b> - Use of Java programming language and development kit for Multi-Platform 
        deployment (using the Java Virtual Machine).</p>
        
        
<p><b>Fast Data-transfer</b> - Support of Parallel File Transfers and Data Downloads.</p>
        
        
<p><b>Email-based Push</b> - Support for Email-based Push Data Acceptance using IMAP, SMTP protocols.</p>
        
        
<p><b>Modeling of remote data sites</b> - Ability to configure &#x201c;Virtual&#x201d; remote directories (based on Metadata 
        such as Date/Time) to download files from.</p>
        
        
<p><b>Integration with other CAS components</b> - Ability to &quot;plug-in&quot; to the CAS File Management 
        and CAS Crawl Framework components for Data Ingestion.</p>

<h2><a name="Extension_Points"></a>Extension Points</h2>
          
<p>We have constructed the Push Pull Framework making use of the <i>factory 
          method pattern</i> to provide multiple extension points for the Push Pull Framework. An 
          extension point is an interface within the Push Pull Framework that can have many 
          implementations. This is particularly useful when it comes to software 
          component configuration because it allows different implementations of 
          an existing interface to be selected at deployment time.</p> 
          
          
<div class="info">The factory method pattern is a creational pattern common to
          object oriented design. Each Push Pull Framework extension point involves the 
          implementation of two interfaces: an <i>extension factory</i> and an 
          <i>extension</i> implementation. At run-time, the Push Pull Framework loads a 
          properties file specifies a factory class to use during extension point
          instantiation. For example, the Push Pull Framework may communicate with a 
          remote FTP site to obtain content, or it may use an IMAPS protocol plugin to 
          accept email-push notifications of available files.
          </div> 
          
          
<p>Using extension points, it is fairly simple to support many different types 
          of what are typically referred to as &quot;plug-in architectures&quot;. Each of the core 
          extension points for the Push Pull Framework is described below:</p>

<td>The Protocol extension point is the heart of the Push Pull framework, 
              responsible for modeling remote sites, and for obtaining their content via

              Push Pull Framework services. This includes the Daemon Launcher interface, 
              as well as the associated Daemon interface, that 
              is managed by with the Daemon Launcher.
