<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
        
<p>
          This is the developer guide for the Apache OODT Catalog and Archive Service (CAS) 
          File Manager component, or File Manager for short. Primarily, this guide 
          will explain the File Manager architecture and interfaces, including its 
          tailorable extension points. For information on installation, configuration,
          and examples, please see our <a href="../user/basic.html">User Guides.</a>
          
          
<p>The remainder of this guide is separated into the following sections:</p>
      
<ul>
        
<li><a href="#section1">Project Description</a></li>

<div class="section">
<h2><a name="Project_Description"></a>Project Description</h2>
        
<p>The File Manager component is responsible for tracking, ingesting and moving 
        file data and metadata between a client system and a server system. The File 
        Manager is an extensible software component that provides an XML-RPC external 
        interface, and a fully tailorable Java-based API for file management.</p> 
      </div>
      
      <a name="section2"></a>
      
<div class="section">
<h2><a name="Architecture"></a>Architecture</h2>
      
        
<p>In this section, we will describe the architecture of the File Manager,
        including its constituent components, object model, and key capabilities.</p>
      
        
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Components"></a>Components</h3>
        
        
<p>The major components of the File Manager are the Client and Server, the 
        Repository Manager, the Catalog, the Validation Layer, the Versioner, and 
        the Transferer. The relationship between all of these components are shown in
        the diagram below:</p>
        
        
<p><img src="../images/fm_extension_points.png" alt="File Manager Architecture" /></p>
        
        
<p>The File Manager Server contains both a Repository that manages products 
        (and the products' location in the archive as specified by Versioner), and a
        Catalog that validates metadata via the Validation Layer. Transfer of data 
        products from the Client to the Server is the domain of the Transfer and can 
        be initiated at either the Client or the Server.</p> 
        
        </div>
        
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Object_Model"></a>Object Model</h3>
        
<p>The critical objects managed by the File Manager include:</p>
        
        
<ul>
          
<li><b>Products</b> - Collections of one or more files, and their 
          associated Metadata.</li>
          
          
<li><b>Metadata</b> - A map of key-&gt;multiple values of descriptive 
          information about a Product. See 
          <a href="../../metadata/">CAS-Metadata</a> for more 
          information on Metadata.</li>
          
          
<li><b>Reference</b> - A pointer to a Product file's (or files') 
          original location, and to its final resting location within the archive 
          constructed by the File Manager.</li>
          
          
<li><b>Product Type</b> - Descriptive information about a Product 
          that includes what type of file URI generation scheme to use, the root 
          repository location for a particular Product, and a description of the 
          Product.</li>
          
          
<li><b>Element</b> - A singular Metadata element, such as &quot;Author&quot;, 
          or &quot;Creator&quot;. Elements may have additional metadata, in the form of the 
          associated definition and even a corresponding 
          <a class="externalLink" href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a> attribute. See 
          <a href="../../metadata/">CAS-Metadata</a> for more 
          information on Metadata Elements.</li>
          
          
<li><b>Versioner</b> - A URI generation scheme for Product Types 
          that defines the location within the archive (built by the File Manager) 
          where a file belonging to a Product (that belongs to the associated Product 
          Type) should be placed.</li>
        </ul>

        
<p>Each Product contains 1 or more References, and one Metadata object. Each 
        Product is a member of a single Product Type. The Metadata collected for each 
        Product is defined by a mapping of Product Type-&gt;1...* Elements. Each Product 
        Type has an associated Versioner. These relationships are shown in the below 
        figure.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Key_Capabilities"></a>Key Capabilities</h3>
        
<p>The File manager has been designed with a new of key capabilities in mind.
        These capabilities include:</p>
        
        
<p><b>Easy management of different types of Products.</b> The 
        Repository Manager extension point is responsible for managing Product Types, 
        and their associated information. Management of Product Types includes adding 
        new types, deleting and updating existing types, and retrieving Product Type 
        Objects, by their ID or by their name.</p>
          
        
<p><b>Support for different kinds of back end catalogs.</b> The 
        Catalog extension point allows Product instance metadata and file location 
        information to be stored in different types of back end data stores quite 
        easily. Existing implementations of the Catalog interface include a JDBC based 
        back end database, along with a flat-file index powered by 
        <a class="externalLink" href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene.</a></p>
          
        
<p><b>Management of Product instance information.</b> Management 
        includes adding, deleting and updating product instance information, including 
        file locations (References), along with Product Metadata. It also includes 
        retrieving Metadata and References associated with existing Products as well 
        as obtaining the Products themselves.</p>
          
        
<p><b>Element management for Metadata.</b> The File Manager's 
        Validation Layer extension point allows for the management of Element policy 
        information in different types of back end stores. For instance, Element policy 
        could be stored in XML files, a Database, or a Metadata Registry.</p>
          
        
<p><b>Data transfer mechanism interface.</b> By having 
        an extension point for Data Transfer, the File Manager can support different 
        Data Transfer protocols, both local and remote.</p>
          
        
<p><b>Advanced support for File Repository layouts.</b> 
        The Versioner extension point allows for different File Repository layouts 
        based on Product Types.</p>
          
        
<p><b>Support for multiple Product structures.</b> The File Manager 
        Client allows for Products to be Flat, or Hierarchical-based. Flat products 
        are collections of singular files that are aggregated together to make a 
        Product. Hierarchical Products are Products that contain collections of 
        directories, and sub-directories, and files.</p>
          
        
<p><b>Design for scalability.</b> The File Manager uses the popular 
        client-server paradigm, allowing new File Manager servers to be instantiated, 
        as needed, without affecting the File Manager clients, and vice-versa.</p>
          
        
<p><b>Standard communication protocols.</b> The File Manager uses 
        XML-RPC as its main external interface between the File Manager client and 
        server. XML-RPC, the little brother of SOAP, is fast, extensible, and uses 
        the underlying HTTP protocol for data transfer.</p>
          
        
<p><b>RSS-based Product syndication.</b> The File Manager web 
        interface allows for the RSS-based syndication of Product feeds based on 
        Product Type.</p>
          
        
<p><b>Data transfer status tracking.</b> The File Manager tracks 
        all current Product and File transfers and even publishes an RSS-feed of 
        existing transfers.</p>
         
        
<p>This capability set is not exhaustive, and is meant to give the user a 
        <i>feel</i> for what general features are provided by the File Manager. Most 
        likely the user will find that the File Manager provides many other 
        capabilities besides those described here.</p>
          
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <a name="section3"></a>
      
<div class="section">
<h2><a name="Extension_Points"></a>Extension Points</h2>
          
<p>We have constructed the File Manager making use of the <i>factory 
          method pattern</i> to provide multiple extension points for the File Manager. An 
          extension point is an interface within the File Manager that can have many 
          implementations. This is particularly useful when it comes to software 
          component configuration because it allows different implementations of 
          an existing interface to be selected at deployment time.</p> 
          
          
<div class="info">The factory method pattern is a creational pattern common to
          object oriented design. Each File Manager extension point involves the 
          implementation of two interfaces: an <i>extension factory</i> and an 
          <i>extension</i> implementation. At run-time, the File Manager loads a 
          properties file specifies a factory class to use during extension point
          instantiation. For example, the File Manager may communicate with a 
          database-based Catalog and an XML-based Element Store (called a Validation 
          Layer), or it may use a Lucene-based Catalog and a database-based Validation 
          Layer.</div> 
          
          
<p>Using extension points, it is fairly simple to support many different types 
          of what are typically referred to as &quot;plug-in architectures.&quot; Each of the core 
          extension points for the File Manager is described below:</p>

<h2><a name="Use_Cases"></a>Use Cases</h2>
        
<p>
          The File Manager was built to support several of the above capabilities outlined in 
          Section 3. In particular there were several use cases that we wanted to support, some 
          of which are described below.        
        </p>
      
         <img src="../images/fm_use_case1.png" alt="File Manager Ingest Use Case" />
         
         
<p>The red numbers in the above Figure correspond to a sequence of steps that occurs and a 
         series of interactions between the different File Manager extension points in order to 
         perform the file ingestion activity. In Step 1, a File Manager client is invoked for the 
         ingest operation, which sends Metadata and References for a particular Product to ingest 
         to the File Manager server&#x2019;s System Interface extension point. The System Interface uses 
         the information about Product Type policy made available by the Repository Manager in order 
         to understand whether or not the product should be transferred, where it&#x2019;s root repository 
         path should be, and so on. The System Interface then catalogs the file References and Metadata 
         using the Catalog extension point. During this catalog process, the Catalog extension point 
         uses the Validation Layer to determine which Elements should be extracted for the particular 
         Product, based upon its Product Type. After that, Data Transfer is initiated either at the 
         client or server end, and the first step to Data Transfer is using the Product&#x2019;s associated 
         Versioner to generate final file References. After final file References have been determined, 
         the file data is transferred by the server or by the client, using the Data Transfer extension 
         point.</p>
