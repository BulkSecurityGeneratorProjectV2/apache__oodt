  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  <p>Getting started with Apache OODT can be a daunting task. With a number of components to setup and configure it can be both time consuming and confusing. To help solve this problem Radix and the Vagrant Virtual Machine were created.</p>

  <h2>RADiX</h2>
  <p>RADiX is a Maven Archtype designed to get OODT up and running quickly and easily. Maven will download the correct libraries and run the correct configuration routines to deploy a fully working OODT platform including File Manage, Workflow, OpsUI etc.</p>

  <p>RADiX can run on both Unix systems and Windows and requires nothing more than a Java JDK and Apache Maven installed on your computer.</p>

  <p>To find out how to get started with RADiX quickly then visit its wiki page here</p>


  <h2>Vagrant VM</h2>
  <p>Vagrant extends upon Radix to give you a configured Virtual Machine with a preconfigured RADiX installation already built and ready along with the networking configuration setup so you can connect to OpsUI without having to change the networking setup.</p>

  <p>The Vagrant VM is idea if you want a portable image that can be replicated time after time or copied around colleagues.</p>

  <p>To get started with the OODT Vagrant VM, visit the wiki page.</p>


  <h2>Apache OODT Wiki Documentation</h2>
  <p>Apache OODT has a number of components and various ways to configure and use each one. To keep the documentation as up to date as possible, we have migrated all our documentation to the Apache OODT Wiki space.</p>

  <p>The documentation on the wiki is updated regularly with component information, tutorials and examples. If you use Apache OODT and would like to help contribute to the sizable documentation effort, then please ask on the development mailing list for details about how you can help with OODT documentation.</p>
