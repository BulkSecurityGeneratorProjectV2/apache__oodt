<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
        
<p>
          This is the developer guide for the Apache OODT Catalog and Archive Service (CAS) 
          Program Generation Executable (PGE) component, or CAS-PGE for short. This guide 
          explains the CAS-PGE architecture as well as its tailorable extension 
          points. 
         
        
<p>The remainder of this guide is separated into the following sections:</p>
       
<ul>
        
<li><a href="#section1">Project Description</a></li>
        
<li><a href="#section2">Architecture</a></li>
        
<li><a href="#section3">Extension Points</a></li>
      </ul>

<h2><a name="Project_Description"></a>Project Description</h2>
        
<p>In order to fully understand the CAS-PGE component, it is helpful to have a solid grasp
        of the CAS Workflow component. If you need some background on CAS Workflow, please
        see our <a href="../../workflow/development/developer.html">CAS Workflow Developer Guide</a>.
        With CAS Workflow in mind, it is often the case that CAS Workflow is used as part of a data 
        processing system - where 
        workflows are responsible for controlling the run order of different Product Generation 
        Executables (PGEs). In circumstances like this, CAS-PGE can help wrap a PGE as part of a
        CAS Workflow. One can think of a PGE as a piece of code, which given a set of inputs, 
        generates output files. Thus, CAS-PGE is designed to help accomplish the most common actions 
        required to run PGEs: ie. finding their input files, executing the PGE, and saving their output files. 
        CAS-PGE performs some of these actions by interacting with a second CAS component as well: 
        CAS File Manager.  The CAS File Manager can be part of this type of workflow-based data processing 
        system, which manages data files, and can support metadata-filtering queries across those
        files to allow for fast retrieval. In other words, CAS File Manger complements CAS-PGE by 
        supporting file cataloging for files involved in PGE operations. </p>
        
<p>In summary, CAS-PGE's role is to provide tools for 
        encapsulating PGEs; however, it also seeks to leverage and make the use of other CAS 
        components to support the aforementioned goal.</p>

<h2><a name="Extension_Points"></a>Extension Points</h2>
	  
<p>PGEs usually need a method by which information is given to them on how
		to run, what to run with (i.e. input files), and where to place the
		output files as well as what to name them. CAS-PGE accomplishes this, and other tasks,
		by making use of customizable extension points.
	 </p>
	 
<p>The following is a description of the most common extension points</p>
	 
<ul>
	   
<li><b>SciPgeConfigFileWriter</b> - writes configuration files for describing how a 
	   PGE will run, with which input files it will run with, and where the output will be placed</li>
	   
<li><b>PcsMetFileWriter</b> - controls which metadata should be sent to the CAS File 
	   Manager (with each output file) for ingestion</li>
	   
<li><b>PGETaskInstance</b> - an extensible module which performs the most generic 
	   and common actions required by typical PGEs. This module makes getting started with a
	   default PGE configuration simple.</li>
	   
<li><b>PgeConfigBuilder</b> - builds a PgeConfig object, which has the ability to
	   control how a CAS-PGE will run</li>
	   </ul>
	   
	   
<p>The relationship between these extension-points and other CAS-PGE components 
	   is described in the below figure. </p>

<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Runtime_Execution"></a>Runtime Execution</h3>
	   
<p>
	   In terms of runtime execution, CAS-PGE makes use of two mediums to configure how a 
	   PGE will run: metadata and a 
	   PgeConfig object. Using these two pieces of information, CAS-PGE can configure how 
	   many configuration files it should generate, which SciPgeConfigFileWriter(s) to use to create 
	   these configuration files, which output files need which PcsMetFileWriter to generate their
		metadata for CAS File Manager ingestion, how to run the PGE, which CAS File
		Manager to talk to, etc.  For the first medium (metadata), there is a set of reserved metadata
		fields that CAS-PGE expects, which affects the way CAS-PGE runs (i.e. which CAS
		File Manager to ingest to).  For the second medium (PgeConfig), the PgeConfigBuilder builds up a 
		PgeConfig object, which can also control how CAS-PGE runs.
