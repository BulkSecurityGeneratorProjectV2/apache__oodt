    <title>Lightweight Profile Handler.

  <body>
    <p>Lightweight profile handler.  The lightweight profile handler
      is lightweight because it doesn't rely on any external
      search/retrieval mechanism.  It's 100% pure Java, baby.
    </p>
    <p>To use this handler, create an XML file that contains the
      profiles you want to serve.  Set the system property
      <code>profiles.url</code>
      to the location of that file.  Fire 'er up.
