<h2><a name="User_Guide"></a>User Guide</h2>
        
<p>
          This is the user guide for the OODT Catalog and Archive Service (CAS) Resource Manager 
          component, or Resource Manager for short. This guide explains the Resource Manager architecture 
          including its extension points. The guide also discusses available services provided 
          by the Resource Manager, how to utilize them, and the different APIs that exist. The guide 
          concludes with a description of Resource Manager use cases.
        </p>     
      </div>
      
<div class="section">
<h2><a name="Architecture"></a>Architecture</h2>
        
<p>The Resource Manager component is responsible for execution, monitoring and tracking of jobs,
        storage and networking resources for an underlying set of hardware resources. The Resource Manager is an 
        extensible software component that provides an XML-RPC external interface, and a fully 
        tailorable Java-based API for resource management. The critical objects managed by the Resource 
        Manager include:</p>
        
        
<ul>
         
<li>Job - an abstract representation of an execution unit, that stores information about an 
         underlying program, or execution that must be run on some hardware node, including information about the 
         Job Input that the Job requires, information about the job load, and the queue that the job should
         be submitted to.</li>
         
<li>Job Input - an abstract representation of the input that a Job requires.</li>
         
<li>Job Spec - a complete specification of a Job, including its Job Input, and the Job definition
         itself.</li>
         
<li>Job Instance - the physical code that performs the underlying job execution.</li>
         
<li>Resource Node - an available execution node that a Job is sent to by the Resource Manager.</li>
        </ul>

        
<p>Each Job Spec contains exactly 1 Job, and Job Input. Each Job Input is provided to a single Job.
        Each Job describes a single Job Instance. And finally, each Job is sent to exactly one Resource Node.
        These relationships are shown in the below figure.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Extension_Points"></a>Extension Points</h3>
          
<p>
          There are several extension points for the Resource Manager. An extension point is an interface 
          within the Resource Manager that can have many implementations. This is particularly useful when 
          it comes to software component configuration because it allows different implementations of an 
          existing interface to be selected at deployment time. So, the Resource Manager component may 
          submit Jobs to a custom XML-RPC batch submission system, or it may use an available off-the-shelf 
          batch submission system, such as LSF or Load-Share. The selection  of the actual component implementations 
          is handled entirely by the extension point mechanism. Using extension points, it is fairly simple to support 
          many different types of what are typically referred to as &quot;plug-in architectures&quot; Each of the core extension 
          points for the Resource Manager is described below:</p>
          
          
<table border="0" class="bodyTable">
            
<tr class="a">
              
<td>Batch Manager</td>
              
<td>The Batch Manager extension point is responsible for sending Jobs to the actual nodes
              that the Resource Manager determines that it is appropriate that they execute on. A Batch Manager
              typically includes a client service, to communicate with remote &quot;stubs&quot;, which run on the local
              compute nodes, and actual handle the physical execution of the provided Jobs.
              </td>
            </tr>
            
<tr class="b">
              
<td>Job Queue</td>
              
<td>The Job Queue extension point is responsible for queueing up Jobs when the Resource Manager
              determines that there are no Resource Nodes available to execute the Job on. Capabilities such as
              persistence, and queueing policy (e.g., LRU, FIFO) are all dealt with by this extension point.</td>
            </tr>
            
<tr class="a">
              
<td>Job Repository</td>
              
<td>The Job Repository is responsible for actual persistance of a Job, throughout its lifecycle in
              the Resource Manager. A Job Repository would handle the ability to retrieve Job and Job Spec information
              whether the Job is queued, or executing, or finished.</td>
            </tr>
            
<tr class="b">
              
<td>Monitor</td>
              
<td>The Monitor extension point is responsible for monitoring the execution of a Job once it has been sent to a
              Resource Node by the Batch Manager extension point.</td>
            </tr>
            
<tr class="a">
              
<td>Job Scheduler</td>
              
<td>The Job Scheduler extension point is responsible for determining the availability of underlying Resource Nodes
              managed by the Resource Manager, and determining the policy for pulling Jobs off of the Job Queue to schedule
              for execution, interacting with the Job Repository, the Batch Manager, the Monitor, and nearly all of the
              underlying extension points in the Resource Manager. </td>
            </tr>
             
<tr class="b">
              
<td>System</td>
              
<td>The extension point that provides the external interface to the Resource Manager 
              services. This includes the Resource Manager server interface, as well as the associated 
              Resource Manager client interface, that communicates with the server.

            </tr>          
          
          </table>

<h3><a name="Key_Capabilities"></a>Key Capabilities</h3>
        
<p>The Resource Manager is responsible for providing the necessary key capabilities for managing 
        job execution and underlying hardware resources. Each high level capability provided by the Resource 
        Manager is detailed below:</p>
        
        
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
          
<li>Easy execution - of compute jobs to heterogeneous computing resources, with very different underlying
          specifications: large and small disks, network file storage, storage area networks, and exotic processor
          architectures.</li>
          
<li>Cluster Management Pluggability - the ability to plug into existing batch submission systems (e.g., Torque, LSF), and 
          resource monitoring (e.g., Ganglia).</li>
          
<li>Scalability &#x2013; The Resource Manager uses the popular client-server paradigm, allowing new Resource Manager 
          servers to be instantiated, as needed, without affecting the Resource Manager clients, and vice-versa. </li>
          
<li>Communication over lightweight, standard protocols &#x2013; The Resource Manager uses XML-RPC, as its main 
          external interface, between Resource Manager client and server. XML-RPC, the little brother of SOAP, is 
          fast, extensible, and uses the underlying HTTP protocol for data transfer.</li>
          
<li>Wrapping - the use of wrappers to insulate the internal code of Job Instances from their external interfaces
          allows a variety of different popular programming languages (e.g., shell scripting, Java, Python, Perl, Ruby) to be
          used to implement the actual job.</li>
          
<li>Scheduler Pluggability - the ability to define the underlying job scheduling policy.</li>
          
<li>XML-based job description - allows for existing XML-based editing tools to visualize the different job
          properties, and for standard job definitions, and interchange.</li>
         </ol>
          
          
<p>This capability set is not exhaustive, and is meant to give the user a &quot;feel&quot; for what 
          general features are provided by the Resource Manager. Most likely the user will find that the 
          Resource Manager provides many other capabilities besides those described here.</p>

<h2><a name="Configuration_and_Installation"></a>Configuration and Installation</h2>
       
<p>
       To install the Resource Manager, you need to download a <a href="../../">release</a>
       of the Resource Manager, available from its home web site. For bleeding-edge features, you can
       also check out the resource trunk project from the OODT subversion repository. You can browse 
       the repository using ViewCVS, located at:</p>
       
       http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/oodt/
       
       
<p>The actual web url for the repository is located at:</p>
       
       https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/oodt/trunk/resource

       
<p>To check out the Resource Manager, use your favorite Subversion client.</p>   
      
      
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Project_Organization"></a>Project Organization</h3>
        
<p>
       The cas-resource project follows the traditional Subversion-style <tt>trunk</tt>, <tt>tag</tt>
       and <tt>branches</tt> format. Trunk corresponds to the latest and greatest development on the
       cas-resource. Tags are official release versions of the project. Branches correspond to deviations 
       from the trunk large enough to warrant a separate development tree. </p>

       
<p>For the purposes of this the User Guide, we'll assume you already have downloaded a built release
       of the Resource Manager, from its web site. If you were building cas-resource from the trunk, a tagged release 
       (or branch) the process would be quite similar. To build cas-resource, you would need the Apache Maven 
       software. Maven is an XML-based, project management system similar to Apache Ant, but with many extra 
       bells and whistles. Maven makes cross-platform project development a snap. You can download Maven from:

      <a class="externalLink" href="http://maven.apache.org">http://maven.apache.org</a>

       All cas-resource releases post 1.0.1 are now <b>Maven 2 compatible</b>. This is <b>very</b> important. 
       That means that if you have any cas-resource release &gt; 1.0.1, you will need Maven 2 to compile the software, 
       and Maven 1 will no longer work.</p>
       
       
<p>Follow the procedures in the below Sections to build a fresh copy of the Resource Manager. These procedures
       are specifically targeted on using Maven 2 to build the software:

<li>cd to cas-resource, and then type:
           
<div class="source">
<pre># mvn package</pre></div>
           This will perform several tasks, including compiling the source code, downloading 
           required jar files, running unit tests, and so on. When the command completes, cd 
           to the <tt>target</tt> directory within cas-resource. This will 
           contain the build of the Resource Manager component, of the following form:

<h3><a name="Deploying_the_Resource_Manager"></a>Deploying the Resource Manager</h3>
      
<p>To deploy the Resource Manager, you'll need to create an installation directory. Typically this 
      would be somewhere in /usr/local (on *nix style systems), or C:\Program Files\ (on windows 
      style systems). We'll assume that you're installing on a *nix style system though the Windows 
      instructions are quite similar.</p>

      
<p>Follow the process below to deploy the Resource Manager:</p>

        
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
         
<li>Copy the binary distribution to the deployment directory
         
<div class="source">
<pre># cp -R cas-resource/trunk/target/cas-resource-${version}-dist.tar.gz /usr/local/</pre></div>
         </li>
         
<li>Untar the distribution
         
<div class="source">
<pre># cd /usr/local ; tar xvzf cas-resource-${version}-dist.tar.gz</pre></div>
         </li>
         
<li>Set up a symlink
         
<div class="source">
<pre># ln -s /usr/local/cas-resource-${version} /usr/local/resmgr</pre></div>
         </li>
         
<li>edit /usr/local/resmgr/bin/resmgr
          
<ul>
           
<li>Set the <tt>SERVER_PORT</tt> variable to the desired port you'd like to run the 
           Resource Manager server on.
           </li>
           
<li>Set the <tt>JAVA_HOME</tt> variable to point to the location of your installed 
           JRE runtime.
           </li>
           
<li>Set the <tt>RUN_HOME</tt> variable to point to the location you'd like the Resource 
           Manager PID file written to. Typically this should default to <tt>/var/run</tt>, but not all 
           system administrators allow users to write to <tt>/var/run</tt>.
           </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
           
<li>edit <tt>/usr/local/resmgr/bin/resmgr-client</tt>
             
<ul>
               
<li>Set the <tt>JAVA_HOME</tt> variable to point to the location of your installed JRE runtime.
               </li>
             </ul>
           </li>
           
<li>(optional) edit <tt>/usr/local/resmgr/etc/logging.properties</tt>
            
<ul>
             
<li>Set the logging levels for each subsystem to the desired level. The system 
             defaults are fairly considerate and prevent much of the logging at levels below <tt>INFO</tt>
             to the console. </li>
            </ul>
           </li>
           
<li>edit <tt>/usr/local/resmgr/etc/resource.properties</tt>
            
<ul>
             
<li>This java properties file contains all of the default information properties to 
             configure the Resource Manager. By default, the Resource Manager is built to use the XML-based 
             Assignment Monitor, the MemoryJobRepository, the LRUScheduler, and the JobStackJobQueue
             extension points.. These defaults can be changed quite easily by changing the factory classes 
             that are pointed to for each extension point. For example, to use your own own home Scheduler 
             extension point, you would change the following property, <tt>resmgr.scheduler.factory</tt> to 
             <tt>org.apache.oodt.cas.resmgr.scheduler.YourNewSchedulerFactory</tt>
            </li>
            
<li>You need to configure the properties for each of the extension points that you are 
            using. By default, you would at least need to configure:
              
<ul>
                
<li>The paths to the directories where the XML policy files are stored for the 
                XML Assignment Monitor. A good default location is to 
                place these files within /usr/local/resmgr/policy.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
           </ul>
          </li>
          
<li>Make sure that  <tt>/usr/local/resmgr/policy/nodes.xml</tt> and <tt>node-to-queue-mapping.xml</tt>  
          correctly point at the batch stub considered to start for execution (by default, localhost:2001). 
          </li>
       </ol>
   
     
<p>Other configuration options are possible: check the <a href="../../apidocs/org/apache/oodt/cas/resource">API documentation</a>, 
     as well as the comments within the resource.properties file to find out the rest of the configurable 
     properties for the extension points you choose. A full listing of all the extension point factory 
     class names are provided in the Appendix. After step 7, you are officially done configuring the Resource 
     Manager for deployment.</p>

<h3><a name="Running_the_Resource_Manager"></a>Running the Resource Manager</h3>
      
<p>To run the resmgr, cd to <tt>/usr/local/resmgr/bin</tt> and type:</p>

      
<div class="source">
<pre># ./resmgr start</pre></div>

      
<p>This will startup the Resource Manager XML-RPC server interface. Your Resource Manager 
      is now ready to run! You can test out the Resource Manager by submitting the following example
      Job, defined in the XML file below (save the file to a location on your system, such as
      <tt>/usr/local/resmgr/examples/exJob.xml</tt>):</p>
      
      <!-- FIXME: Change namespace URI? -->
      
<div class="source">
<pre>
      &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&gt;
      &lt;cas:job xmlns:cas=&quot;http://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/1.0/cas&quot; id=&quot;abcd&quot;
	      name=&quot;TestJob&quot;&gt;
	      &lt;instanceClass

			&lt;property name=&quot;user.name&quot; value=&quot;Homer!&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/properties&gt;
	    &lt;/inputClass&gt;
	  &lt;queue&gt;quick&lt;/queue&gt;
	  &lt;load&gt;1&lt;/load&gt;
     &lt;/cas:job&gt;
    </pre></div>
    
      
<p>The above job definition tells the resource manager to execute the <tt>org.apache.oodt.cas.resource.examples.HelloWorldJob</tt>,
      which is one of the example Jobs that is shipped with the Resource Manager. The job simply echoes the name provided in the <tt>user.name</tt>
      property back to the screen, saying <tt>Hello ${user.name}!</tt>.
      </p>

      
<p>To run the job, first you must start an XML-RPC batch stub, to execute the job on the local node. Let's assume a default port of port <tt>2001</tt>:</p>

      
<div class="source">
<pre># ./batch_stub 2001
      </pre></div>
      
      
<p>The command to run the job, assuming that you started the Resource Manager on the default port of <tt>9002</tt>:</p>

      
<div class="source">
<pre>
      java -Djava.ext.dirs=../lib org.apache.oodt.cas.resource.tools.JobSubmitter \
                       --rUrl http://localhost:9002 \
                       --file /usr/local/resmgr/examples/exJob.xml
      </pre></div>

      
<p>You should see a response message at the end similar to:</p>

<h2><a name="Use_Cases"></a>Use Cases</h2>
        
<p>
          The Resource Manager was built to support several of the above capabilities outlined above. 
          In particular there were several use cases that we wanted to support, some 
          of which are described below.        
        </p>
      
         <img src="../images/rm_use_case1.jpg" alt="Resource Manager Job Execution Use Case" />
         
          
<p>The black numbers in the above Figure correspond to a sequence of steps that occurs and a 
         series of interactions between the different Resource Manager extension points in order to 
         perform the job execution activity. The Job provided to the Resource Manager (labeled <tt>Process Manager</tt>
         in the above diagram) is sent by the Workflow Manager, another CAS component responsible for modeling task
         control flow and data flow. In Step 7, the job is provided to the Resource Manager, which uses its
         Scheduler extension point in Step 8, along with the Monitor extension point, to determine the appropriate
         Resource Node to execute the provided Job on (in steps 9-11). The information returned in Step 11 to the
         Scheduler is then used to determine Job execution ability. Once the Job is determined &quot;ready to run&quot;, in 
         Step 12, the Scheduler extension point uses the Batch Manager extension point (not shown) to submit the
         Job to the underlying compute cluster nodes, monitoring the Job execution using the Monitor extension point
         shown in Step 13.</p>
